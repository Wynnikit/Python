#Program that finds intercept points between a circle and a line if they exist.
#by S. Allen


'''Write an interactive graphics program that finds the intersection(s)
of a circle and horizontal line.

Interactive Input:  

    A mouse click to determine the radius of the circle
    a text entry (in graphics window) to determine the y-intercept
    of the line segment

Output:

    Draw a circle centered at (0,0) with given radius in a window with
    coordinates such that x runs from -10 to 10 and y runs from -10 to 10.  
    In the same window, draw a horizontal line segment with the specified
    y-intercept. In the same window, draw any intersection point(s) in red
    Print out the coordinates of the intersection(s) if any.  (Note it says
                                                               print not draw)

Formula: (see book)Formula: x = Â± sqrt(r**2-y**2)

Note: This problem is based on a textbook exercise but asks for the
    information in a very different way.  



need a window 10x10
start circle creation, in parameters, getmouse input for radius
    r = radius'''
